## Why this repo?

Certain customers using Collibra’s on-premise products CPSH and Collibra Data Quality & Observability, operate under stringent requirements that necessitate the need to inject customized headers and footers, called banners, into Collibra. This is not officially supported in Collibra’s existing features. In order to support these customers, I wrote this workaround. This ensures that customers can meet their compliance obligations and take full advantage of Collibra CPSH and Collibra Data Quality & Observability (DQO) platforms.
