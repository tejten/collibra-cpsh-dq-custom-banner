# Collibra DQO Guide — Overview

Customizing headers and footers in Collibra Data Quality and Observability.

## Scope
Certain customers using Collibra’s on-premise product, Collibra Data Quality & Observability, operate under stringent requirements that necessitate the need to inject customized headers and footers, called banners, into Collibra. This is not officially supported in Collibra’s existing features. Use this workaround to support these customers. This ensures that customers can meet their compliance obligations and take full advantage of Collibra Data Quality & Observability (DQO).
